# Tensorflow U-Net for uncertainty prediction

This repository contains code for a U-Net model implemented in Tensorflow.
Originally it was developed for doing Image Segmentation for Single Tree Detection.

`std_unet.py` contains code for training and testing the U-Net model `unet/model.py`. 
Some configuration can be done with commandline arguments, but most is done within the script.

**This is a work in progress, still with many TODOs**
